# OARnet Screening Question
In order to showcase our coding abilities and skills, we were asked to sample our coding through a screening question. General details can be found below:
- Use python.
- Write a TCP server & client.

## Instructions
In order for the program to work, simply follow the instructions provided.
1. Save both `client.py` and `server.py`. They don't need to be in the same folder, but it might make it easier to navigate.
2. Open two terminal windows: one for the server and one for the client.
3. Run the server first in one terminal by using the command `python server.py`.
4. Run the client in the second terminal by using the command `python client.py`.
